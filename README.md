# 100DaysOfCodeChallengeOnPython
Ciao tutti! ðŸ‘‹

This is my repo for my #100DaysOfCode Challenge based on Python and by the guidance of Dr. Angela Yu on her Udemy course ["100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023
"](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). It is a projected-based approach that encourages consistent coding practice.

Validating in several places, including the [official website](https://www.100daysofcode.com/faq/) (although there are many dedicated spots, now), I agree that due to unforseen circumstances to be flexible is key to maintaining the momentum and improvement:

My commitment? Never miss two consecutive days of code if I can. If possible, finish the challenge in up to 100 consecutive days, even if there is the need to code the bootcamp to the equivalent of two days in one only at times (only on special ocasions). After all, life and this challenge are in parts about dedication, commitment and consistency, and not just tallying numbers.

I attempted this challenge in the past 12 days or so, but struggled to code consistently. Now, I am determined to persevere â€” even if I miss parts of it again (which I will make up for) I will go on.

Let's remember that counting consecutive days isn't our primary goal or focus. Instead, we are here to learn, commit and improve. Also, in my experience, I see this challenge as even a way to be able to better organize my personal life. There's always room for growth! If circumstances beyond my control temporarily disrupt my progress on the challenge, that's okay. Time is relative, but giving up is not an option.

So, I'll adapt the challenge as needed â€” perhaps coding two days in one to catch up as I said above. But I'll stay true to the core of the challenge.

If you are also on this journey: best of luck! Let's code, learn, and embrace the adventure. ðŸš€
